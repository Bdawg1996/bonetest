<h1>It all began in 2015...</h1>
<p>I was fresh out of high school and I wanted a summer job that I loved.
    Working at my favorite food spot for free food sounded nice, or working at 
    my favorite retail store for an employee discount sounded great, but neither 
    of these things I knew I would be drivin to get out of bed and work hard. 
</p>

<h2>But then I discovered I could do what I loved</h2>
<p>I have loved dogs, although not having my own until Sadie came along (more about 
    her later) for my entire life. Discovering that I could build a career by hanging 
    out and taking care of dogs was better than the time I found out about pre sliced bread!  
</p>
<p>And so the story goes I signed up for Rover and walked some of the best dogs in my neighborhood 
    in Santa Monica until I left for College at SFSU where I got my degree in dog walking (ok just kidding
    it's really in Business Management). I then tried the food business, and the retail business but 
    just like I suspected years before, it wasn't for me. I just felt a lack of impact on what I cared 
    about. I got a job at a dog hotel where I spent days supervising up to 30 dogs in an indoor yard. Seperating 
    them based on temperments. 
</p>

<h2>Who let the dogs out!</h2>

<p>Now this was what I needed. I am fortunate enough to have connected with Lauren, the owner of Who Let the Dogs out 
dog walking company. The hotel was great but my level of care of detail orientation is better used for a special group
directly. My time with WLTDO showed me the impact a dedicated daily play group for a dog is so beneficial in maintaing 
healthy and controllable energy and dog tolerance levels.</p>

<h2>Now, more about Sadie</h2>
<p>Sadie was the first dog that my family had gotten. She was my first full time dog. She was a pitbull, very very sweet
    girl but Sadie had a traumitizing past before we rescued her from the shelter. Unfortanutely this led to her being a little
    rough around the edges, but certainly never violent. She would play bite but forget how strong she is. It was not mean spirited 
    and was something that I today could have trained out of her. I would like to dedicate my company Bone Cadets to Sadie, since 
    we had to bring her back to the No-kill shelter where she went through training to get ready for her next family. I know you're a 
    good girl Sadie wherever you are and I promise to never give up on another dog.
